    "summary": "I hail from the one and only California Bay Area which undoubtedly helped spur my interest in tech. I started making websites from a young age (Pokemon cards) and quickly moved into dynamic website development (for muscle cars!). I went to university for Software Engineering, but quickly realized it was nowhere near as useful as my experience working as a Ruby developer. I dropped out moved abroad in 2011 to pursue work in Helsinki, Finland. Since then I've traveled to over 10 countries and lived in Finland, Germany, and Sweden. I've continued to travel around the world speaking with passion on software engineering fulfilling my desire to travel and improve the world around me by educating others.",
